Here you will meet your pilot, receive a safety briefing and watch the inflation of your balloon.</p><p class="mt-3" data-v-278ea2d3>At dawn we take off, rising as the sun rises and floating in whichever direction the winds of the morning take us. Our pilot can precisely control the altitude of our balloon: sometimes flying at treetop height, sometimes lower, offering a unique perspective and great photographic opportunities of the wildlife below. At other times our pilot may ascend to 1,000 ft or more, to see the enormity and wonderful panorama of the Serengeti. From time to time the pilot must put more heat into the balloon with the powerful whisper burners. In between these burns, there is silence apart from the natural sounds below.</p><p class="mt-3" data-v-278ea2d3>The flight is for about one hour, depending on conditions, and eventually we must land. We celebrate in the traditional manner with champagne (well, an excellent sparkling wine) before sitting down to a full English breakfast prepared and served in the bush in “Out of Africa” style with bone china, linen table cloth, Sheffield cutlery etc.</p><p class="mt-3" data-v-278ea2d3>After breakfast, you receive your Serengeti Balloon certificate and later meet up with your safari driver at approximately 09:45 ready to continue your day’s activities.</p><div class="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mt-5 mb-5" data-v-278ea2d3><div data-v-278ea2d3><h1 class="gloria primary text-xl mb-2" data-v-278ea2d3>Seasons:</h1><ul class="list-disc" data-v-278ea2d3><li data-v-278ea2d3>Central Serengeti: All year-round</li><li data-v-278ea2d3>Ndutu: 20th Dec – 31st Mar</li><li data-v-278ea2d3>Western Corridor: 15th May – 30th Oct</li><li data-v-278ea2d3>North Serengeti: 15th Jun – 15th Jan</li></ul><h1 class="gloria primary text-xl mb-2 mt-2" data-v-278ea2d3>Cancellations:</h1><ul class="list-disc" data-v-278ea2d3><li data-v-278ea2d3>14 days prior to flight – no fees charged</li><li data-v-278ea2d3>13 days – 7 days – 50% charged</li><li data-v-278ea2d3>6 days – 48 hours – 75% charged</li><li data-v-278ea2d3>Less than 48 hours – 100% charged</li><li data-v-278ea2d3>No Show – 100% charged</li></ul><p class="mt-2 mb-2" data-v-278ea2d3>THE ABOVE TERMS APPLY WHATEVER THE REASONS FOR CANCELLATION</p><p data-v-278ea2d3> IF WE CANCEL: (e.g. weather/technical) WE REFUND IN FULL or if you wish and we have availability we will offer the opportunity to fly the following day</p></div><div data-v-278ea2d3><h1 class="gloria primary text-xl mb-2" data-v-278ea2d3>Price Includes:</h1><ul class="list-disc" data-v-278ea2d3><li data-v-278ea2d3>Transport from the lodge or camp to the launch site</li><li data-v-278ea2d3>Balloon flight (approx one hour)</li><li data-v-278ea2d3>Sparkling wine</li><li data-v-278ea2d3>Full English breakfast in the bush</li><li data-v-278ea2d3>Return road transfer to Seronera Visitor Centre (or in North Serengeti, Western Corridor &amp; Ndutu to pre-arranged rendezvous)</li></ul><h1 class="gloria primary text-xl mt-2 mb-2" data-v-278ea2d3>Restrictions:</h1><p data-v-278ea2d3> We do not carry children under the age of 7.
