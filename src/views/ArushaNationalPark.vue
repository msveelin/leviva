            <p>Nestled at the foothills of Mount Meru in Tanzania, Arusha National Park is a captivating blend of diverse
                landscapes, rich wildlife, and stunning vistas. While often overshadowed by its larger neighbors, this
                hidden gem offers a unique and intimate safari experience for those seeking the road less traveled.</p>
            <h2 class="font-bold mt-3 mb-2">Mount Meru's Majesty:</h2>
            <p class="mt-2">The park's centerpiece is the majestic Mount Meru, Tanzania's second-highest peak. Towering over
                the savannah, the mountain provides a dramatic backdrop to the park's landscapes. Adventurous visitors can
                embark on the challenging trek to Meru's summit for panoramic views of the surrounding plains and distant
                Mount Kilimanjaro.</p>

                with giraffes and zebras, and marvel at the alkaline lakes that attract a myriad of bird species, including
                flamingos. The park is also home to buffalos, warthogs, and elusive leopards.
