                <p>A tour to Materuni Village and Waterfalls is a great way to spend a day away from the
                    bustle of town life. The walk to Materuni Waterfall offers a glimpse into the nature of
                    Tanzania allowing you either to prepare your body for the forthcoming climb to
                    Kilimanjaro or ease your muscles after the climb.

                <h2 class="primary gloria text-xl mt-2 mb-3">Itinerary</h2>
                <p>The Materuni Waterfall tour starts with a walk through the area adjacent to the
                    waterfall, rich in beautiful natural scenery of Tanzania. It is an opportunity to see how
                    local fruit like avocados, mangos, lemons, and bananas grow, as well as learn some of
                    the local history, traditions, village economy, agricultural and cultural life. When you
                    get to the waterfall, you can refresh yourself in the natural pool, so swimsuits will
                    come in handy!
                    .</p>
                <p class="mt-2">The tour will continue with a visit to the local village lying in the coffee plantations.
                    The
                    villagers will demonstrate the process of coffee farming and guide you through the
                    preparation of coffee from a bean to a cup. Sing and dance along with the Chaga
                    people as they are grinding, roasting, and boiling the beans. When the coffee is ready,
                    villagers will serve lunch - a national Chagga meal.</p>
